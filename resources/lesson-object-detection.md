## Introduction to Object Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### Lesson Overview
In this lesson, we will delve into object detection, another critical use case of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision apart from Image Classification as we have seen earlier. We will explore various algorithms, including R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and YOLO, emphasizing their architectures and practical applications in real-world scenarios.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this brief lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain the fundamental concepts of object detection using CNNs.
- Describe the functioning and differences among various object detection algorithms.
- Identify key use cases for object detection across different industries.
- Analyze a simple object detection architecture and its components.
- Discuss the advantages and challenges associated with object detection methods.

### Key Definitions and Examples
**Object Detection Definition:**  
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video by generating bounding boxes around them.

**Object Detection Example:**  
For instance, in a self-driving car application, an object detection model can identify pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signals in real-time to ensure safe navigation.

- **R-CNN:** A two-stage model that generates region proposals and classifies them using CNNs. It improves accuracy but is slower due to multiple processing stages.
  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** A one-stage model that predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in a single evaluation, making it faster but potentially less accurate than R-CNN variants.
