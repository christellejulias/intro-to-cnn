#CFU: Introduction to Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks 

## Introduction :pencil2:
This activity will help you practice and assess the knowledge and skills you just learned. During a bootcamp, it's important to spend a lot of time practicing what you've learned. The exercises given to you are just the start. You will get the opportunity to practice more in labs and later, in projects.
We encourage you that once you finish the exercises on the Student Portal platform, try to find more challenges to work on online.
Note: You are provided with solutions to each exercise. The purpose of providing solutions to exercises is to allow you to compare your own work to see if you have a similar or correct approach. It is not meant to be used as a way to cheat or copy the answers. It is important to understand the reasoning behind the solution in order to improve your own understanding and problem-solving abilities.
Concept 1 Exercise
Instructions
Describe the basic structure of a CNN.
Explain the role of convolution and pooling layers in feature extraction.

<details style="font-size: 14px; cursor: pointer; outline: none;"> <summary> Click for Solution </summary> 1. A CNN typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. 2. Convolution layers extract features by applying filters, while pooling layers reduce dimensionality and retain essential information. </details>
Concept 2 Exercise
Instructions
Identify a real-world application of CNNs in image classification.
Discuss one advantage and one limitation of using CNNs.

<details style="font-size: 14px; cursor: pointer; outline: none;"> <summary> Click for Solution </summary> 1. A real-world application is facial recognition in security systems. 2. An advantage is their ability to learn hierarchical features; a limitation is their requirement for large datasets for effective training. </details>
