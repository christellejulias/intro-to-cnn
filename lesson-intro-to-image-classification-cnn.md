## Lesson Overview :pencil2:
In this lesson, we will explore the essential concepts behind image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a key element in the field of computer vision. We’ll break down how CNNs work, focusing on critical components such as convolution, filters, and pooling layers. Additionally, we’ll look at practical applications of CNNs in tasks like object detection and image classification, providing a clear understanding of their significance in real-world scenarios.

• Discuss the advantages and limitations of using CNNs for image classification tasks.

## Key Definitions and Examples :key:
### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Definition
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model specifically designed to process structured data like images. They leverage a mathematical operation called convolution, which allows them to automatically identify patterns and features within images through multiple processing layers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Example
Think of an image as a 2D matrix filled with pixel values. A CNN applies a filter (or kernel) over this matrix to perform convolution, extracting features such as edges or textures. For instance, when a 3x3 filter is applied to an image, it slides across the matrix, performing element-wise multiplication and summing the results to generate a feature map that highlights specific characteristics.

-**Convolution Definition:**
Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to create a third function, illustrating how one function modifies another. In CNNs, convolution involves sliding a filter over an input image to compute feature maps.

-**Convolution Example:**
For example, if we have an input image with pixel values and a 3x3 filter designed to detect vertical edges, the convolution operation will emphasize areas in the image where there are significant changes in pixel intensity vertically. This results in a new feature map that indicates where vertical edges are present.

-**Pooling Layers Definition:**
Pooling layers are integral to CNNs as they reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps while preserving important information. This down-sampling process helps lower computational demands and mitigate overfitting by summarizing features detected by previous layers.

-**Pooling Layers Example:**
A common pooling method is Max Pooling, which selects the maximum value from each patch of the feature map defined by a specified window size (e.g., 2x2). For instance, if we apply Max Pooling on a 4x4 feature map using a 2x2 window, we would reduce it to a 2x2 matrix by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 region.
